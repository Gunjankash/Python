# Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

# for number in range(11):
#     print(number)

# count = 0
# while count < 11:
#     print(count)
#     count =  count+1


# Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.


# Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

#   #
#   ##
#   ###
#   ####
#   #####

# Use nested loops to create the following:

# Print the following pattern:

# 0 x 0 = 0
# 1 x 1 = 1
# 2 x 2 = 4
# 3 x 3 = 9
# 4 x 4 = 16
# 5 x 5 = 25
# 6 x 6 = 36
# 7 x 7 = 49
# 8 x 8 = 64
# 9 x 9 = 81
# 10 x 10 = 100
# Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.

# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers

# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers

# Exercises: Level 2
# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.
# The sum of all numbers is 5050.
# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

# The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
# Exercises: Level 3
# Go to the data folder and use the countries.py file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word land.
# This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
# Go to the data folder and use the countries_data.py file.
# What are the total number of languages in the data
# Find the ten most spoken languages from the data
